The residuation logic for the unary connectives, ⋄i □i is used to define a feature checking procedure.Each mode i represents some morphosyntactic feature. Underspecification is dealt with by assuming general modes that are related to specific instances by inclusion postulates.The distribution of features is regulated by means of distribution postulates.The mixed multimodal approach is compared to some other versions of extended categorial grammars that deal with morphosyntactic issues.},

    abstract = "We present {\AE}THEL, a semantic compositionality dataset for written Dutch. {\AE}THEL consists of two parts. First, it contains a lexicon of supertags for about 900 000 words in context. The supertags correspond to types of the simply typed linear lambda-calculus, enhanced with dependency decorations that capture grammatical roles supplementary to function-argument structures. On the basis of these types, {\AE}THEL further provides 72 192 validated derivations, presented in four formats: natural-deduction and sequent-style proofs, linear logic proofnets and the associated programs (lambda terms) for meaning composition. {\AE}THEL{'}s types and derivations are obtained by means of an extraction algorithm applied to the syntactic analyses of LASSY Small, the gold standard corpus of written Dutch. We discuss the extraction algorithm and show how {`}virtual elements{'} in the original LASSY annotation of unbounded dependencies and coordination phenomena give rise to higher-order types. We suggest some example usecases highlighting the benefits of a type-driven approach at the syntax semantics interface. The following resources are open-sourced with {\AE}THEL: the lexical mappings between words and types, a subset of the dataset consisting of 7 924 semantic parses, and the Python code that implements the extraction algorithm.",

The resulting corpus, CCGbank, includes 99.4\\% of the sentences in the Penn Treebank. It is available from the Linguistic Data Consortium, and has been used to train wide-coverage statistical parsers that obtain state-of-the-art rates of dependency recovery.In order to obtain linguistically adequate CCG analyses, and to eliminate noise and inconsistencies in the original annotation, an extensive analysis of the constructions and annotations in the Penn Treebank was called for, and a substantial number of changes to the Treebank were necessary. We discuss the implications of our findings for the extraction of other linguistically expressive grammars from the Treebank, and for the design of future treebanks.}",
