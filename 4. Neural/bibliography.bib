    abstract = "{Current supervised parsers are limited by the size of their labelled training
                    data, making improving them with unlabelled data an important goal. We show how
                    a state-of-the-art CCG parser can be enhanced, by predicting lexical categories
                    using unsupervised vector-space embeddings of words. The use of word embeddings
                    enables our model to better generalize from the labelled data, and allows us to
                    accurately assign lexical categories without depending on a POS-tagger. Our
                    approach leads to substantial improvements in dependency parsing results over
                    the standard supervised CCG parser when evaluated on Wall Street Journal (0.8\\%),
                    Wikipedia (1.8\\%) and biomedical (3.4\\%) text. We compare the performance of two
                    recently proposed approaches for classification using a wide variety of word
                    embeddings. We also give a detailed error analysis demonstrating where using
                    embeddings outperforms traditional feature sets, and showing how including POS
                    features can decrease accuracy.}",
