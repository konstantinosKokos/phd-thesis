    abstract = "{Current supervised parsers are limited by the size of their labelled training
                    data, making improving them with unlabelled data an important goal. We show how
                    a state-of-the-art CCG parser can be enhanced, by predicting lexical categories
                    using unsupervised vector-space embeddings of words. The use of word embeddings
                    enables our model to better generalize from the labelled data, and allows us to
                    accurately assign lexical categories without depending on a POS-tagger. Our
                    approach leads to substantial improvements in dependency parsing results over
                    the standard supervised CCG parser when evaluated on Wall Street Journal (0.8\\%),
                    Wikipedia (1.8\\%) and biomedical (3.4\\%) text. We compare the performance of two
                    recently proposed approaches for classification using a wide variety of word
                    embeddings. We also give a detailed error analysis demonstrating where using
                    embeddings outperforms traditional feature sets, and showing how including POS
                    features can decrease accuracy.}",

    abstract = "Unsupervised representation learning algorithms such as word2vec and ELMo improve the accuracy of many supervised NLP models, mainly because they can take advantage of large amounts of unlabeled text. However, the supervised models only learn from task-specific labeled data during the main training phase. We therefore propose Cross-View Training (CVT), a semi-supervised learning algorithm that improves the representations of a Bi-LSTM sentence encoder using a mix of labeled and unlabeled data. On labeled examples, standard supervised learning is used. On unlabeled examples, CVT teaches auxiliary prediction modules that see restricted views of the input (e.g., only part of a sentence) to match the predictions of the full model seeing the whole input. Since the auxiliary modules and the full model share intermediate representations, this in turn improves the full model. Moreover, we show that CVT is particularly effective when combined with multi-task learning. We evaluate CVT on five sequence tagging tasks, machine translation, and dependency parsing, achieving state-of-the-art results.",
