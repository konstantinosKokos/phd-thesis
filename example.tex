%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Customize this template to suit your needs. DO NOT define the commands 
% that are commented out below, unless you need to change them.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Select the right University as a class option (download the .clo file first).
% Defined: utrecht.clo, leiden.clo, nijmegen.clo, groningen.clo, aclc.clo
% If your institute is not defined, write me to ask for it.
%
\documentclass[utrecht]{lotdiss}
%
% The default font size is 10pt, but can be changed in the usual way:
% \documentclass[utrecht,11pt]{lotdiss}
%
% See the manual for description of the options [preview] and [notitlesec]

% [preview] will change the declared paper size to the true LOT book 
% size (24x16cm). This IS NOT NECESSARY: The printing shop wants
% A4 pages and will do the rest. Only works with PDF output.

% Add [notitlesec] if for some reason you need to suppress loading the 
% package titlesec.sty 



% You might want to collect all your preamble LaTeX code (below) and put it in a 
% special file, e.g., declarations.tex
%\include{declarations}

% Add packages and definitions you want to use:
%\usepackage{times}
%\usepackage{gb4e,qtree}
% etc.

% Uncomment to generate an index (but you probably won't bother until the end)
% \makeindex


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  The dissertation's title pages  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% These are the default sizes for titles. Customize them if you wish:
%\let\TitleSize=\huge
%\let\SubtitleSize=\LARGE
%\def\TitleStretch{1.4}

% If your titles are too long to fit on one line, indicate desired breaks with \\
\title{Title of Your Dissertation}
\subtitle{A Suitable Subtitle\\on Multiple Lines}

% Define the Dutch title (unless your entire Dissertation is in Dutch)
\dutchtitle{Nederlandstalige Titel}
\dutchsubtitle{De Tweede Regel van Je Titel, \\ ook Vrij Lang}

% For dissertations with tri-lingual titles, you'll have to redefine \@titlepage!

% For Groningen dissertations, only English is supported


% Fill in here as appropriate.
\author{Your Name}
\geboren{1 januari 2000 \\ te Place, Country}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Contents of page ii, which contains the publisher details and book metadata

% You'll get these from the LOT office
\isbn{000-11-22222-33-4}  
\NUR{000}  

% A description or credit for the cover illustration
\imagecredit{Cover illustration: The Tower of Babel, by Pieter Bruegel}

% If the current year is not the correct copyright year, override it here
%\copyrightyear{2009}

% The copyright claim is automatically generated, but you can override it:
%\copyrightclaim{Copyright \copyright\ 2009 by Anonymous. All rights reserved.}

% You can add a note in the space just above the publisher details (p. ii)
%\abovepublisher{The research reported here was supported by a generous 
%  grant from my grandparents etc. etc. etc.}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The promotors page

% This will be formatted inside a table on page iv. 
% If necessary, add co-promotors etc. as shown
\promotors{
Promotores:  & Prof. Dr. D. E. Knuth \\
			 & Prof. Dr. L. Lamport \\
%[4pt] Co-promotores: &  Prof. Dr. H. Kopka\\
%						& Dr. P. W. Daly \\
}

% OPTIONAL: Acknowledgment of the project that funded the research, the NWO grant, etc.
% It will appear at the bottom of the promotors page, as recommended by LOT guidelines.
% 
% \support{
%   The research reported here was supported by the Netherlands Organization 
%   for Scientific Research under project number 000-00-000.
% }

% The rector's name is already set from the style files. 
% If is out of date, you can adjust it here (but please also notify me)
%\rectormagnificus{Dr. D.D. Breimer,\\
%  Hoogleraar in de faculteit der Wiskunde en Natuurwetenschappen en die der Geneeskunde}

% Fill this in when you have a promotion date
% \promotiondate{donderdag 10 december 2009 \\ klokke 16.15 uur}

% Dedication page (Optional): The dedication is vertically centered on the page, 
% and otherwise formatted only as you specify
%
% If you have a really short Dedication (no more than one
% paragraph) you can define it here:
\dedication{\raggedleft
	This example is dedicated to everyone \\
	who hates to read manuals.
}
% ALTERNATELY, you can put the dedication in a separate file, e.g. dedication.tex:
%\dedicationfile{dedication}


\begin{document}
% The following command now generates your opening pages:
\FrontMatter

% Include any other front-matter sections. Their titles should be formatted 
% with \chapter* e.g., \chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\include{acknowledgements}
% \include{abbreviations} % etc.

\MainMatter  % Turns on regular page numbering, etc.

% The regular (numbered) chapters.

\include{introduction}
\include{ch2}
\include{ch3}
\include{ch4}
\include{conclusion}

%% The declaration \appendix begins the appendices. 
%% Appendix chapters must appear before \BackMatter. Don't ask why...
%
%\appendix
%\include{appendixA}

\BackMatter
%% For bibliography, indices, etc.

%\bibliographystyle{linquiry2}
%\bibliography{myreferences}

% If you're making an index (also uncomment \makeindex in the preamble)
%\printindex

% Required post-chapter sections: 
% Dutch-language summary, curriculum vitae

\include{dutch-summary}
\include{CurriculumVitae}


\end{document}
